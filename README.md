# COMP3602-Project

project for the course Data analysis and visualization with python 

## Part 1:

1. Dataset description
2. Attributes Description
3. bar plot to display the frequency distribution of all attributes
4. frequency distribution table for continues numerical attributes
5. Research questions (2-3)

--- 

## Part 2:

1. Fill mising values with the mean of that column 
2. Use boxplots to indetify features with outliers, replace them with the mean of that feature
3. Use labelEncoder for catigorical features 
4. Scale the features with minMax normalization
5. Analyze the dataset as its in long (tidy) or wide format. If it is already in long format, then convert it (by selecting 2 or more variables) to wide and visa-versa.
6. Implement ANOVA method to identify irrelevant features, compute the F-statistics, bar chat to visualize the computed F- statistics and provide a list of the identified irrelevant features
